## Orchards-Problems

###
Three apple growers formed a cooperative to maximize their collective profit. During their annual meeting, they planned next year's production based on each farmâ€™s arable land and available water, as shown in Table 1. Each farm can produce red, rose, and green apples, each with different profit margins and water requirements. To avoid market oversupply and profit reduction, a cap on the production of each apple type was set in previous meetings (Table 2). Due to drought-related water scarcity, farms cannot use their full land capacity. To ensure fairness, all farms must use the same proportion of their available land. For instance, if the first farmer uses 200 of 400 hectares, the second must use 300 of 600 hectares. The optimal cultivation area for each apple type in each field was determined to maximize net profit under these constraints. The problem was modeled as a Linear Programming problem and solved using CPLEX. Input data were read from Excel files, and the optimal values were output to a new sheet.
